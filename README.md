# NavigationComponentPlayground

This is a setUp of Navigation Drawer & BottomNavigationView with Navigation Component work perfectly together

This is how I done it:
1. Add Navigation Component dependency
2. Created layout 
3. Created nav_graph.xml to navigation directory
4. Created bottom_navigation_menu
5. Created activity_main_drawer menu 
6. Add some anim to nav_graph.xml action
7. Created 4 fragments
8. SetUp all thing in MainActivity.kt (where the  magic happens :D)
9. Build and enjoy

Update : In last commit I added ViewPager2 and TabLayout and here it is how I done it:
1. Added 2 more fragments
2. Created ViewPagerAdapter for viewPager
3. Added ViewPager2 and TabLayout tags in fragment_second xml file
4. SetUp all thing in SecondFragment class (where the  magic happens :D)
5. Build and enjoy
