# NavigationComponentPlayground

This is a setUp of Navigation Drawer & BottomNavigationView with Navigation Component work perfectly together

This is how I done it:
1. Add Navigation Component dependency
2. Created layout 
3. Created nav_graph.xml to navigation directory
4. Created bottom_navigation_menu
5. Created activity_main_drawer menu 
6. Add some anim to nav_graph.xml action
7. Created 4 fragments
8. SetUp all thing in MainActivity.kt (where the  magic happens)
9. Build and enjoy
